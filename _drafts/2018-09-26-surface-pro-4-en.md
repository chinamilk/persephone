There are many standards for one to choose a new computer, such as
the performance, the outlooking, the portability, or the compromise of those above. It depends on where and how you use it.

I spent nearly two years to choose a new computer for the successor of my acer. It sounds exaggerated. I couldn't make a decision maily for the limitation of the money.

What do I think about:

- I use the computer mainly to deal with the pictures and write articles.
- I hardly ever play computer games. So it needn't make high performance. It's ok to power both PS and AI.
- It need to be portable. There was a period of time when I didn't know where I would be after a week. It must be thin and easy to carry for me.
- It need to have a good outlooking. I don't like the designs of Apple. I link the outlooking of Thinkpad X1 after I go through a computer store.
- Money still make a huge limitation. I didn't choose the X1 because it was beyond my budget.

Finally, I choose the Surface Pro 4. After rational thinking, searching and comparing for nearly two years, the intuition make the decision. When I was resting and listening to musics in a sofa of a cafe, I placed the order. Maybe I was not implutive at that time for it gives me all what I want.

It seems full of consideration except one thing: I couldn't predict that I would be a programmer at that time. So I push a piece of reason to the *Considerable Elements Stack*, which is ""
